# C++ Learning for CUDA

This repository contains my personal notes and small projects as I learn **C++** with the goal of writing efficient **CUDA** kernels.

## Goals
- Build a strong understanding of modern C++ basics.
- Focus on pointers, memory management, and performance.
- Gradually transition to GPU programming with CUDA.
